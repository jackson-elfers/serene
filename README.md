## About

This is a lightweight spa implementation of create-react-app that won't make me cry (as much). It uses a simple folder structure to support a minimal usage of redux for user state and global error handling. Hooks are used to fetch api data and manage independent component state.

## Install

```
npm install
npm run start
```
